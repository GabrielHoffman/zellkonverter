      zellkonverter provides methods to convert between Python AnnData objects
      and SingleCellExperiment objects. These are primarily intended for use by
      downstream Bioconductor packages that wrap Python methods for single-cell
      data analysis. It also includes functions to read and write H5AD files
      used for saving AnnData objects to disk.
